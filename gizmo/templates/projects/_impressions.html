	<p>2018 Award of Merit winner from the AASLH, this website explores the mid-19th century discovery of strange, 3-toed footprints, later understood as dinosaur tracks, in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The significance of this first scientific discovery extended far beyond the emerging scientific community, with implications that had a profound effect not only on science but also on American religion, arts, and culture.</p>
